My girlfriend wanted a new website... but it had to be special. Some design she long ago came up with. In years I came across a lot of javascript tools that provided me with stuff I needed, but never a script that contained all functionallity in one script. gummyBear is an attempt to have all these functions in one script.

Current features:

+ position objects on screen and have them repositioned when changing screensize.
+ turn a list into multiple objects and create a dropdown select from it to navigate toward it.
+ give objects drag and drop functionallity
+ give objects parallaxing abilities.
